<h1>Drawing With Points in WebGL: Draw various types of lines</h1>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
    For this activity, you'll continue to practice simple WebGL drawings using vertex points. Your goal is to alter the
    code in the
    Assisted Code tab to create lines. Try creating both dashed and solid lines. If you get stuck, you can peek at our
    implementation by clicking on the
    Solution tab.
