<h1>Drawing With Points in WebGL: Draw an Arc</h1>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
    For this activity, you'll continue to practice simple WebGL drawings using vertex points. Your goal is to alter the
    code in the
    Assisted Code tab to create an arc. If you get stuck, you can peek at our implementation by clicking on the
    Solution tab.
